# Node-Demo-App

A MEAN stack web-application is created using Angular.js, NodeJS & Express to save data to MongoDB Database. 
I have created a very simple Node application, that will allow users to input data that they want to store in a MongoDB database. It will also show all items that have been entered into the database.
A code is written which creates the application by calling express, the port defined is 3000. 

Technologies used: HTML, Node.js, Express.js, JSON, Angular.js, Restful APIs, CRUD methodology, MongoDB.

Below are the screenshots of the web-app:
